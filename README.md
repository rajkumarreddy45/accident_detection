## Introduction

Accident detection systems are crucial in improving emergency response times and potentially saving lives. This project uses a CNN to automatically detect accidents from images or video frames. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of accident and non-accident images, allowing it to learn and recognize patterns associated with accidents.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Detect accidents in real-time from video frames or static images.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes a CNN for high-accuracy detection.
- **Scalable**: Can be integrated into various applications, including traffic monitoring systems and vehicle safety mechanisms.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accident-detection.git
   cd accident-detection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset should consist of labeled images categorized into two classes: `accident` and `non-accident`. You can create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets. Ensure the data is organized in the following structure:

```
data/
    train/
        accident/
        non-accident/
    validation/
        accident/
        non-accident/
```

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used for accident detection is based on a standard architecture, which includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture can be customized based on specific requirements and dataset characteristics.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your dataset is prepared and organized as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. The script will split the data into training and validation sets, train the CNN model, and save the best model based on validation accuracy.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model on a test dataset:

1. Ensure you have a test dataset organized similarly to the training dataset.
2. Run the evaluation script:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the trained model for accident detection on new images or video frames:

1. Ensure you have a trained model saved.
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image_path path_to_image
   ```
   or for video:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --video_path path_to_video
   ```

## Results

The results of the accident detection model will be displayed, indicating whether an accident is detected in the given image or video frame. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will also be provided.
